## Description: 
The Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) Program unites students across campus in undergraduate education and faculty research in a team-based context. Undergraduate VIP students earn academic credits, while faculty and graduate students benefit from the design/discovery efforts of their teams. This program cultivates leadership and mentoring while creating long-term research and development experiences.
## Requirements:
Students completing VIP for their junior design requirement are required to complete at least three semesters of VIP on the same project, with a minimum of 5 hours, and LMC 3403.
## Building for Equity and Sustainability
- This VIP takes as its main focus Georgia Tech’s new Living Building – the Kendeda Building for Innovative Sustainable Design – and its efforts to advance social equity as one of seven key performance areas in the Living Building Challenge. This VIP also explores equity and resilience in sustainability projects on Georgia Tech’s campus and in surrounding partner communities in Atlanta.
- Georgia Tech and its surrounding communities have been making major strides to advance equity as a key piece of creating a sustainable built environment - and sustainable and resilient communities overall. The Kendeda Building is at the forefront of this innovation. This VIP aims to push Georgia Tech to deepen and broaden its focus on equity as core to sustainability. Our research will explore equity in theory and practice. Our action will involve trying out new ideas about equity to see how they work in practice
